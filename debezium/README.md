# Debezium Connector

Starting with Hazelcast Jet version 4.2, Change Data Capture connectors
have been moved to the main repository and are part of the standard
distribution.

There is support for [generic Debezium connectors](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/tree/master/extensions/cdc-debezium),
and also specific support for [MySql](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/tree/master/extensions/cdc-mysql)
and [Postgres](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/tree/master/extensions/cdc-postgres)
ones.
