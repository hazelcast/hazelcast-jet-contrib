# hazelcast-jet-contrib

This repository includes various community supported and incubating 
modules for [Hazelcast Jet](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet).

As a general guideline, the following types of modules are encouraged
in this repository:

* Various connectors, including both sources and sinks
* [Context factories](https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/jet/3.0/javadoc/com/hazelcast/jet/pipeline/ContextFactory.html).
that potentially integrate with other systems.
* Custom [aggregations](https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/jet/3.0/javadoc/com/hazelcast/jet/aggregate/AggregateOperation.html).
These should be generic enough that they should be reusable in other
 pipelines.

## Building from source

To build the project, use the following command

```
./gradlew build
```
