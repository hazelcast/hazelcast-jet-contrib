## Getting Started

### Installing

The Hazelcast Apache Pulsar Connector artifacts are published on the Maven repositories.

Add the following lines to your pom.xml to include it as a dependency to your project:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.hazelcast.jet.contrib</groupId>
    <artifactId>pulsar</artifactId>
    <version>${version}</version>
</dependency>
```
If you are using Gradle: 
```
compile group: 'com.hazelcast.jet.contrib', name: 'pulsar', version: ${version}
```
## Running the tests

To run the tests run the command below: 

```
./gradlew test
```
## Usage

Describe the module usage and how it interacts with the rest of the system. The
entry point of the module must be included in this section like `InfluxDbSinks.influxDb()`.

End with a very small example/snippet of getting some data out of the system 
or using it for a little demo

## Fault-Tolerance
Describe F-T behavior, give information about whether the source is replayable, 
talk about checkpointing and transactional reads. For sinks describe idempotence 
and/or transactional writes.

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

```
./gradlew test
```
